# Ultimate Monopoly Prototype

Comp302 / Software Engineering / Fall 2017

### Prototype Functionality
You are asked to build a small prototype of the original Monopoly game as described below.

The game board will consist of 20 squares. In other words, each side of the game board will be six (6) squares long. The small board you will build will be similar to the middle layer of the Ultimate Monopoly board reproduced on the next page. You are asked to implement the original Monopoly game rules on this reduced board. 
  You are not asked to implement the following Monopoly features:
    Houses and house-related features
    Hotels and hotel-related features
    Mortgaging properties
    Trading properties
    Squares not listed on the reduced game board (e.g., jail, railroads, tax)
    Auction and bargaining
    The Chance and Community Chest cards
    All other Monopoly rules (e.g., rolling the dice, the amount of money players start with) should be implemented as described on the     ultimate monopoly document published on the course pages on Blackboard.
